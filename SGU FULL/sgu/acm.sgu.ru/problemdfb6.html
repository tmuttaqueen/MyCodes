<b>N</b> friends gathered
in order to play chess, according to the following rules. In the first
game, two of the <b>N</b> friends will play. In the second game, the winner
of the first game will play against another friend (maybe even the same
friend who lost the first game). In the third game, the winner of the second
game will play against someone else and so on.. No game will end as a draw
(tie). Given the number of games each of the <b>N</b> friends played, find
a schedule for the games, so that the above rules are obeyed.

The first line contains
the number of friends <b>N</b> (<b>2&lt;=N&lt;=100</b>). The second line
contains
<b>N</b> integers, separated by blanks, representing the number
of games each friend played. The first number represents the number of
games played by the first friend, the second number represents the number
of games played by the second friend and so on..

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first line should
contain the number of games played by all the friends (it will be an integer
between <b>1</b> and <b>10 000</b>, for every test case). Let's suppose
this number is <b>G</b>. Then, <b>G</b> lines follow, each of them containing
two integers, describing the games. The first line contains the numbers
of the two friends who played the first game. The friend printed first
is considered to be the winner. Each of the next <b>G-1</b> lines contain
the integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, where
<b>a&lt;>b</b> and <b>a</b> or
<b>b</b>
is the winner of the previous game. The friend printed first on the line
is considered to be the winner of the game.
<br>It is guaranteed that
for every test case there will be at least one possible scheduling of the
games.
