Bob really <b>LOVES</b>
chocolate. He thinks he never gets enough. Imagine his joy when his parents
told him that they would buy him many rectangular chocolate pieces for
his birthday. A piece of chocolate is a <b>2x1</b> or <b>1x2</b> rectangle.
Bob's parents also bought him a nice birthday cake, which can be imagined
as a matrix having <b>M</b> rows and <b>N</b> columns. Some positions on
the cake are occupied by candles, the others are empty. Bob's parents asked
their son to place as many chocolate pieces as he can on the empty squares
on the cake, in such a manner that no two chocolate pieces overlap. However,
he would like to keep the chocolate pieces to himself. That's why, he wants
to place only a minimal amount of them on the cake and keep the rest. In
order not to make Mon and Dad suspicious, Bob wants to place the chocolate
pieces in such a way, that no other piece may be placed on the cake (that
is, there won't exist any two adjacent empty squares). Find the minimal
number of pieces which need to be placed on the cake, so that they do not
overlap and no extra piece may be added.

The first line of
the input contains <b>2</b> integers: <b>M</b> (<b>1&lt;=M&lt;=70</b>)
and <b>N</b> (<b>1&lt;=N&lt;=7</b>). Next, <b>M</b> lines will follow,
each of them containing <b>N</b> characters, describing the cake. The character
on row <b>i </b>and column <b>j </b>of the cake may be either a <b><tt>'*'</tt>
</b>(ASCII code <b>42</b><tt>)</tt>, representing a candle, or a<b><tt>
'.' </tt></b>(ASCII code <b>46</b>), representing an empty square.

You should output
one integer: the minimal amount of pieces of chocolate which need to be
placed on the cake.
